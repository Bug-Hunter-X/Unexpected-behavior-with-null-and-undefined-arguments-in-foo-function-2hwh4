# Unexpected behavior with null and undefined arguments in foo function
This bug demonstrates an issue where the foo function does not correctly handle null or undefined arguments. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

## Bug Description
The function does not handle null or undefined values gracefully.  When null or undefined values are passed as arguments, it does not return an appropriate error or default value, leading to unexpected results.

## Solution
The solution involves adding explicit checks for null or undefined values before using them within the function. The function should return an appropriate default value or throw an error if null or undefined values are passed.
